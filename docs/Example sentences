# Situational
##### Beginning
“She enters the room, her eyes are red, she looks briefly in your direction before looking back at the floor. She stopped at the entrance, her left hand quibbling with the hem of her t-shirt.”
Small pause
“When she stopped talking, she took a deep breath while closing her eyes.”
“She sniffs once before speaking again.”
“She quickly runs her hand over her eyes to wipe away some tears.”


##### Words
Greetings
“Hello.”

##### Summary
“One month ago, I had a night out with some friends. We went out to a club. My boyfriend didn’t want to go, but one of our friends asked me to go and wing for her. So I did. And then, she went off with the person that she was interested in. Then he came and started dancing with me, since he knew I was in a relationship, and that he was a friend of ours, I didn’t think anything of it. I… I don’t hold my drink very well. If I had… I… Anyway, when I decided to go home, he offered to walk me back. I was drunk, it was dark, I’m a woman… I was grateful to him. I thought it would be safer. And then, I was in my room, and I turned around and saw that he was also in my room. I didn’t understand what was going on. And he wasn’t wearing anything, and he was taking my clothes off. I didn’t want him to. I was scared and then he put me on the bed…”

##### After
“I was still in this frozen state of shock, and then I saw that my phone was ringing and it was my boyfriend calling me. And that unfroze me, it took that to make me remember how to move, and I put on a t-shirt and ran to my boyfriend. He saw me standing on the doorstep, not clothes, crying and he immediately assumed that something really bad had happened. My boyfriend suggested that we go to the police and I was very clear that was not at all something that I wanted to do. Well I just thought that you’d blame me. That it would be my fault and that the emphasis would be put on me and what I had done.”

##### Affirmative
“Yes, please.”
“Thank you.”

##### Negative
“No, I can continue. I must do it.”
“No, thank you.”

##### After reassurance
“Thanks, I understand what you said, it’s just hard to believe.”
“I see, thanks, I guess.”

##### Where
“At my apartment, in my room.”

##### When
“Last Month, on Friday night, the 16th. I… I don’t know the hour for sure, maybe between 3 to 6.”
“I started to worry when I saw him in my bedroom. I didn’t ask him to enter my apartment, but he followed me inside. Before that, I never suspected that something was off. He was just as kind as usually, and I trusted him.”

##### Who
“He is in our group of friends, we are in the same university. He is kind to everyone, I didn’t know… I couldn’t know… He is tall, always smiling. Always helpful. I thought he was a good person.”

##### What did you do
“Nothing. I didn’t do anything. I couldn’t. I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry loudly for help. I didn’t struggle. I just froze. I completely froze and I was incapable of doing anything. I was incapable of even moving my limbs. And mostly out of fear, I was almost like a doll while he was manipulating my body because I was incapable of moving my own limbs or… I was scared. I just froze.”

##### What did he do
“When I saw him naked in front of me, I tried to tell him to stop, and to get out, but before I could finish, he started to undress me. Then he pushed me on the bed. And I couldn’t talk anymore. And I couldn’t move. I was frozen, and he… I remember his shoulder was right in front of my face, and I stared at his shoulder for a bit because it was all that I could see and then I just stared at the bedside table next to my bed, waiting for it to stop and… and it did, in the end.”

##### Questions from the bot
“I can’t stop telling myself that I shouldn’t have drank that much, maybe, if I hadn’t…”
“This morning again, I wake up wondering : “What should I have done?””
“If only I was able to tell him off, or to defend myself, maybe he would have…”

##### Have talked to someone / has to
“Well… After… that, I talked about this to my boyfriend, he is quite understanding. But no one else knows. My friends are wondering why I’m so silent, and I just can’t persuade myself to talk to them. They wouldn’t understand. They wouldn’t believe me. I don’t want to have to defend myself, or to justify that it happened to me.”

##### Anything to add to the deposition
“There is nothing else on my mind right now. I confirm this deposition.”
“Nothing else, should I contact you if I remember anything else?”

##### Retraite Positive
“Thanks for your time, have a good day.

##### Retraite Negative
“I’m sorry, I’m wasting your time, I shouldn’t have come. I’m sorry, I’ll take my leave. Have a good day, I guess.”
“I should have listened to my instincts instead of following my boyfriend’s advice. He suggested that I come here. I shouldn’t have.”
