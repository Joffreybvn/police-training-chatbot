    - text: I was still in this frozen state of shock, and then I saw that my phone was ringing and it was my boyfriend calling me. And that unfroze me, it took that to make me remember how to move, and I put on a t-shirt and ran to my boyfriend. He saw me standing on the doorstep, not clothes, crying and he immediately assumed that something really bad had happened. My boyfriend suggested that we go to the police and I was very clear that was not at all something that I wanted to do. Well I just thought that youâ€™d blame me. That it would be my fault and that the emphasis would be put on me and what I had done.
