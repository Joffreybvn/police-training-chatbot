# Menu page

- Application home page
- The police officer chooses which situation he wants to train on

### UI concept:

</p>



- Lists all situations present in the application
- Each box is a button, with an image and a title. On click, the policeman arrives on a chat.
- Like the Netflix homepage, but way clearer and simpler

### Pitch requirements
The pitch will be short (2-3 minutes), and remote (via screen sharing). The UI must therefore be simple and clear, in order to survive the small screens and the low quality of some internet connections. Our viewers must understand and appreciate our application in a blink of an eye.

So:
- A simple UI
- No small text
- Text where (and only where) it is needed.
- Clear images
