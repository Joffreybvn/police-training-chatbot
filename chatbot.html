                            ringing and it was my boyfriend calling me. And that unfroze me, it took that to make me
                            remember how to move, and I put on a t-shirt and ran to my boyfriend. He saw me standing on
                            the doorstep, not clothes, crying and he immediately assumed that something really bad had
                            happened. My boyfriend suggested that we go to the police and I was very clear that was not
                            at all something that I wanted to do. Well I just thought that youâ€™d blame me. That it would
                            be my fault and that the emphasis would be put on me and what I had done.</span></div>
