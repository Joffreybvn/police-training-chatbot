## UI concepts

The user interface is the most important element of our project: it is the visible side of our features. We need to put as many features as possible on our UI to show what the application will look like in the future.

- Concept: [Menu page](./concepts/menu.md)

### UI to survive the pitch
The pitch will be short (2-3 minutes), and remote (via screen sharing). The UI must therefore be simple and clear, in order to survive the small screens and the low quality of some internet connections. Our viewers must understand and appreciate our application in a blink of an eye.

So:
- A simple UI
- No small text
- Text where (and only where) it is needed.
- Clear images
