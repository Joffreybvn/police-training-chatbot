# Police Training Chatbot

### Pitch:
Training chatbot to put police officers in any situations. AI generates new scenarios every time, with different levels of difficulty, intensity, and clarity in the speakers' words, about:
 - Daily missions
 - Rape
 - Kidnapping
 - Hit-and-run
 - ...

The police officer can choose among the resolution options offered by AI. Or he can write his resolution directly in the chatbot.

This chatbot will be useful for the recruitment of new police officers, but also for the training/education of officers in the course of their career. Furthermore, the answers provided by the police officer could be used by psychologists to analyse his behaviour.

After the Hackathon, could evoluate into VR situations, with speech recognition.

### Working example

 - Transcription declaration of people + errors committed by the policeman, regarding of the procedure.
